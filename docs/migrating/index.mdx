# Migrating from v1.x to v2.0

Upgrading to Automock v2.0 brings a host of improvements designed to enhance your testing experience. This guide
outlines the key changes and steps for a smooth migration.

## What's New in v2.0

- **Enhanced Developer Experience**
    - Improved error handling with more specific and informative error types for easier debugging.
    - Enhanced JSDoc documentation for better API understanding.

- **Robustness and Flexibility**
    - Internal changes in `@suites/adapters.nestjs`, `@suites/core`, `@suites/common`, and `@suites/types` to
      make the library more robust and flexible.

- **Native Test Doubles Support**
    - One of the notable updates is the transition to using native test doubles instead of the `jest-mock-extended`
      library. By leveraging native test doubles, Automock now provides better compatibility across different testing
      frameworks, making it easier to integrate and utilize its capabilities within your preferred testing ecosystem.

## Key Migration Steps

### Manual Installation of NestJS Adapter

In v1.x, the NestJS adapter came bundled by default. In v2.0, you'll need to install it manually:

```bash npm2yarn
$ npm i -D @suites/adapters.nestjs
```

## Wrapping Up

The migration from v1.x to v2.0 is designed to make Automock more robust, flexible, and user-friendly. If you encounter
any issues or have questions, feel free to consult the updated documentation or seek community support.

Thank you for using Automock, and we hope you enjoy the new features and improvements in v2.0!
