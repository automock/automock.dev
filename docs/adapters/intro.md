# Introduction

## Adapters: Bridging Frameworks and Dependency Injection

Automock is a flexible solution that seamlessly integrates with a variety of testing frameworks and dependency
injection (DI) frameworks through the concept of "Adapters." These Adapters serve as connectors, enabling Automock to
work harmoniously within different contexts and frameworks, providing automatic mocking and dependency injection
capabilities for your unit tests.

### Integration with Dependency Injection Frameworks

Automock's adaptability extends to dependency injection frameworks, such as NestJS, Inversify, and more. Each framework
demands a distinct integration approach to resolve dependency references. Nonetheless, the Automock API remains uniform,
allowing you to employ consistent methods and patterns regardless of the framework in use.

### Unified API, Varied Functionality

Automock excels in offering a unified API while seamlessly adjusting to the intricacies of different frameworks.
Fundamental methods, such as `UnitReference` `.get()` and `MockOverride` `.mock()`, retain their consistency across frameworks. However, the outcome of
these methods might differ based on the underlying testing or DI framework.
