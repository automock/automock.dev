# The Suites Ecosystem

Suites offers a robust suite of components and resources as part of its testing stack:

## DI Framework Adapters
With adapters like `@suites/adapters.nestjs` for NestJS and potential future support for
other frameworks, Suites facilitates dependency injection in tests, streamlining the setup of test environments.

## Mocking and Doubles Libraries
Packages such as `@suites/jest` integrate popular mocking libraries, enabling
developers to simulate external dependencies and isolate the code under test.

## Continuous Integration Templates
Suites includes templates for continuous integration and deployment processes, helping teams
automate their testing workflows and ensure consistent, reliable delivery.

## Project Skeletons
To jumpstart new projects, Suites provides project skeletons that preset common configurations
and setups, reducing initial overhead and promoting best practices from the outset.

## Learning Center
A comprehensive resource for developers to learn about testing strategies, methodologies, and the
use of Suites itself. Itâ€™s aimed at both new and experienced developers seeking to deepen their understanding of
effective testing practices.
