# Unit Testing

## Introduction

Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development, ensuring that individual units of code function are
correctly in isolation. These concepts have been extensively discussed in the writings of Martin Fowler. He
distinguishes between two main types of unit tests, which will be the focus of this section.

## Unit Tests in The Context of Suites

Object-oriented design tends to treat a class as the "unit," procedural or functional approaches might consider a single
function as a unit. **In the context of Suites, we consider the smallest unit to be a class**, and distinguish between
two types of what is called "unit testing."
