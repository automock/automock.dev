# Continuous Integration & Suites

Software development is a complex process that involves multiple stages, from writing code to deploying it to
production. Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that aims to automate the integration of code changes
from multiple developers into a single software project. This practice helps to detect and fix bugs early in the
development process, which in turn reduces the time and effort required to integrate and deploy the code.
