# Motivation

## Why?

The idea behind Automock is that unit testing in modern software development can be greatly enhanced. We realized that
when working with dependency injection frameworks, developers frequently encounter issues when using conventional
testing techniques. These difficulties include the time-consuming task of manually configuring stubs and mocks,
guaranteeing type safety, and preserving test isolation. Automock seeks to solve these issues by developing a tool that
automates the mocking process, streamlines test setup, and improves test efficiency and reliability. **This will
hopefully free up developers to write more solid tests suits without worrying as much about the finer points of test
configurations, leading to better code and faster development cycles.**

## Advantages

**Type Safety and Error Reduction** - By generating mocks that retain the same type information as the actual objects,
Automock leverages TypeScript's static type checking. This approach minimizes the risk of type-related errors in tests,
leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

**Efficient Test Execution** - Automock's approach to mocking can lead to faster test execution times. By bypassing the
loading and configuration of actual dependencies, tests can run more quickly, enhancing the overall development
workflow.

**Consistent Test Structure** - Maintaining a consistent structure and syntax in unit tests is crucial for readability
and maintainability. Automock encourages a uniform approach to writing tests, making it easier for teams to understand
and work with each other's code.

**Reduced Maintenance Overhead** - Manually maintaining mocks to keep up with changes in the actual dependencies can be
a significant overhead. Automock's automatic mock generation alleviates this burden, ensuring that mocks are always in
sync with their corresponding real implementations.

**Developer-Friendly API** - Automock is created with a focus on usability, offering an intuitive and straightforward
API. This makes it accessible to developers of varying experience levels and reduces the learning curve associated with
unit testing.
